#About microSWIFT

microSWIFT is a low-cost, expendable, freely drifting wave buoy built by at the UW Applied Physics Lab.  It uses the Iridium satellite network to report real-time ocean wave data. It also supports additional measurements such as surface salinity and temperature via auxilliary sensors.

microSWIFT can be deployed from an aircraft through a standard A-size Sonobuoy tube.  This make it ideal for collecting wave data in environments not accessible by ship, such as in the path of a hurricane or in polar regions.  It can also be delployed by hand over the side of a ship like a traditional buoy or drifter.

The name microSWIFT owes to the fact that it is a miniaturized version of a SWIFT wave drifter.  SWIFT is an acronym for Surface Wave Instrument Float with Tracking.
