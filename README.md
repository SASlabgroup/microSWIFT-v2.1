# microSWIFT-v2.1
Documentation, source code, and CAD files for verion 2.1 of the microSWIFT wave buoy

microSWIFT is a low-cost, expendable, freely drifting wave buoy built by at the UW Applied Physics Lab.  It uses the Iridium satellite network to report real-time ocean wave data.  
microSWIFT can be deployed from an aircraft through a standard A-size Sonobuoy tube.  This make it ideal for collecting wave data in environments not accessible by ship, such as in the path of a hurricane or in polar regions.  It can also be delployed by hand over the side of a ship like a traditional buoy or drifter.
